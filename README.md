# Identification-the-Reasons-of-Data-Breaching

I used three algorithms for class balancing-
1- Random Oversamplin
2- SMOTE
3- ADASYN


We have two files of code-
1- Model_Building_Without_Class_Balancing

It has the code of the model without performing Class Balacing.

2- Model_Building_With_Class_Balancing

It has the code of the models with class Balancing.
